So apparently we have to have a prototype of button tapping done by Febuary 7th.
Meeting Notes from 1/31:
1. Have a prototype done by next Tuesday 2/7
  -Count the number of taps
  -Test the left hand and the right hand
  -Count taps for 10 seconds 
  -Figure out how to alert the user that the counter is starting/stopping
  -Test each hand 5 times and average results
  -Allow the tap area to be as big as possible
